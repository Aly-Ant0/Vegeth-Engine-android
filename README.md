VEGETH ENGINE by VegethYT 

If you wanna compile the engine follow the instructions if u wanna the exe download it [here](https://gamejolt.com/@VegethYT/Vegeth-Engine)

First download [Haxe 4.1.5](https://haxe.org/download/version/4.1.5)

Downlaod [Git](https://git-scm.com) 

After that download [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/it/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=16)

Now install this [Setup](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JT3EE7dJk9MKNzr2-YbojiMwJ23Mh4L2/view) an put it in the same folder as the Visual Studio installer and Haxe installer
(do not worry it is not a virus :|) click yes on all the things it says but not the one it says fix transitional camera bugs

After that you can finally compile. Just open the command promt where there's the project.xml file.

Do lime test windows or lime test windows -debug if you wanna have debug tools

Then if you wanna build lime build windows

THE ENGINE DOES NOT WORK ON MAC AND LINUX SO IF YOU WANNA COMPILE IT YOU MUST HAVE A WINDOWS COMPUTER :\ (sorry for mac and linux peeps)
